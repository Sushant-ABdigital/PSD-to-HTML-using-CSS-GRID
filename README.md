# PSD to HTML using CSS GRID
In this project, I have coded using CSS grid and flexbox. I selected this free PSD from website and commenced to code using CSS grid and flexbox.

This is the website for someone who is financial analyst as well as travel enthusiast.

###### Please note this website is currently under progress. As of now, only the main page is coded, I will update once the project is completed.
